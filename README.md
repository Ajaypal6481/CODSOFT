Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

This repository contains a Tic-Tac-Toe AI agent implemented using the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning. The AI agent plays against a human player, making moves to maximize its chances of winning.

Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-ai.git
Navigate to the repository directory: cd tic-tac-toe-ai
Run the game: python main.py

Gameplay:

The game starts with an empty board.
The human player makes a move by entering the row and column numbers (0-2).
The AI agent makes its move based on the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
The game continues until a winner is determined or the game is a draw.

Note:

This implementation assumes that the human player makes valid moves.
The AI agent is unbeatable, so be prepared to lose!
